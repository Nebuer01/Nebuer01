Hey, I’m Nebeur01, I’m interested in many things software and hardware. I enjoy experimenting with different hardware components and how they can be changed by just changing some software. I am currently taking robotics as a course to help increase my skills and because its enjoyable.

I also enjoy playing around with different operating systems, creating local servers and considering security. Going along with this, I am taking an interest in learning networking and the wide variety of applications that's possible.
<!-- As a hobby, I also do technical production, especially audio engineering which also includes a wide range of different software and hardware working together across multiple different areas such as lighting and projection -->
In my free time, I am currently learning the unity game engine along with C# and expanding my skills in webdevellopemnt, aiming to have proficiency in full stack.
